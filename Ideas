Power ups are hidden around the map in each level like a paint gunner to help the player paint faster/more effectively to paint the entire level,
the percentage of the level painted is shown at the top center of the screen and painting 80% of the level allows the player to move to the next level,
each level gets harder to paint completely with moving walls and hidden sections in the walls etc… one power up could be instapaint (like the nuke
power up in nazi zombies) it could instantly paint everything in a certain range of the player etc… at the beginning of each level the player can only
throw small pain balls until they find better power ups hidden around the map to help paint better and more effectively and quickly!
After 80% completion the player can move to the next level or choose to continue and try to get up to 100%, if 100% is completed on all levels, the player
gets to go to a bonus level (like the original Spyro game for ps1) I really like this idea do you guys? I think I would be more interesting
than just making the maps mazes to get through and the game would have more of a goal to it.
